# StepperGUI

ESP32-S3 based GUI for controlling stepper motor systems using ESP-NOW wireless communication. Features position limiting for safety and comprehensive debugging capabilities.

## Hardware


## Key Features

### Safety & Control

### User Interface

### Communication & Debugging

## Hardware Setup

### JC4827W543C Device

## Position Limiting System

The GUI implements safety limits to prevent hardware damage:


### Position Flow
1. ESP-NOW receives position from StepperController
2. Raw position shown in RX message box (may be outside safe range)
3. Position clamped to 50-1550 range using `clamp_position()`
4. Clamped position shown in blue position text box
5. Safe position sent to stepper motor

## Build Environments


### JC4827W543C build notes
For the `JC4827W543C` environment the build requires an extra include path and a few LVGL compile-time defines so that shared headers and Montserrat font objects are found during compilation and linking. If you edit `platformio.ini` manually, ensure the environment includes:


These flags are applied to the `[env:JC4827W543C]` build_flags in the project so the LVGL library builds the Montserrat font objects and enables logging. Without them you may see missing-header or undefined LVGL font / logging symbols at link time.

## Configuration

Key configuration constants in `main.cpp`:
```cpp
#define MIN_STEPPER_POSITION 50    // Safe margin above down limit
#define MAX_STEPPER_POSITION 1550  // Safe margin below up limit
uint8_t controllerMAC[] = {0xEC, 0xE3, 0x34, 0xC0, 0x33, 0xC0};
```

Touch calibration and display pins are configured for JC4827W543C hardware.

## Recent Updates




## Batch Scripts for Syncing Code

- **download_latest_code.bat**: Pulls the latest code from both StepperGUI and MagLoop_Common_Files.
- **upload_code_if_changed.bat**: Checks for changes in both repositories and pushes updates only if changes are detected.

### Usage

1. Double-click or run `download_latest_code.bat` to update your local code from GitHub.
2. Double-click or run `upload_code_if_changed.bat` to push any local changes to GitHub. If there are no changes, the script will warn and do nothing.

These scripts automate the most common sync operations for development.

## development environment

---
**NOTE: This is the final version of StepperGUI using mechanical limit switches and position limiting. Future development will use the TCRT5000 Infrared Reflective Photoelectric Switch IR Tracking Sensor Module for end-stop detection, and position limiting code will be removed.**

All position limiting and limit switch logic is now archived for reference. If you need the last version with limit switches, use the `limit-switches-final` git tag or branch.

* PlatformIO 6.1.18
